# Medica — Build & Technical Specification

A complete, self-contained specification for building Medica. It defines the product's flows as discrete steps; for each step it states **who** performs it (actor, role, permission), **what** it serves (feature), **how** it is realized (backend API and frontend component), and **which data** the API exchanges with the component.

---

## 1. What Medica is

Medica is a telehealth weight-management service. A patient signs up, is assessed for eligibility for GLP-1 therapy, subscribes, has an online doctor visit, and receives the medication through a nurse who visits their home and administers the injection. The product spans a patient app, a doctor panel, a nurse app, a pharmacy-hub panel, an admin/operations panel, a customer-service panel, and an affiliate panel.

The first launch is a supervised pilot of fewer than 50 patients. At that scale some operations are run by hand and automated later; those are tagged in the steps.

## 2. How to read this document

Each step is written as:
```
STEP-ID — description · serves F-xxx · [status]
  actor: role (scope)
  requires: permission(s)
  api  · API-ID · METHOD /path · service · what it provides
    data · ← fields the component sends · → fields the component receives
  comp · CMP-ID · Name · mfe · what it shows/does
```

- **STEP_ID** = `STEP-<month><flow-letter?>-<nn>` (e.g. `STEP-3B-07`).
- **API_ID** = `API-<service>-<nnn>`. Services: `auth, patient, prov, visit, field, pay, pharm, sub, notif, crm, rpt, gw`.
- **COM_ID** = `CMP-<mfe>-<nnn>`. Microfrontends: `PAT, DOC, NUR, PHM, ADM, CS, AFF`; shared `SHL`.
- **status** — omitted means built in our own code. Otherwise: `[int·party→M_]` third-party integration, `[manual→M_]` done by hand until the noted month.
- **data line** — `←` lists the fields the component sends (request body). `→` lists the fields the API returns to the component. **The `→` list is the serializer allowlist for that step**: any entity field not listed is intentionally withheld (sensitive or unused). Field names come from the entities in the companion data model; an entity shown as `entity{ … }` means a row/object of that entity with the listed fields. `(derived)` marks a read model computed from events rather than a stored row.

### Process diagrams (BPMN)

The flows below are also drawn as end-to-end BPMN swimlanes; each diagram task is labelled with the `STEP-`/`API-` id it depicts. See the diagram alongside the spec when implementing a flow:

- `P1_onboarding_eligibility_subscription.bpmn` — Month 1–3 sign-up → eligibility → subscribe (`STEP-1A-*`, `STEP-2-*`, `STEP-3A-*`).
- `P2_visit_external_prescription.bpmn` — Month 3 Flow B online visit + external Rx (`STEP-3B-*`, `API-VISIT-005/006`).
- `P3_home_visit_fulfillment.bpmn` — Month 4–6 dose order → nurse → settlement (`STEP-5-*`, `STEP-4A/4B-*`, `STEP-6-*`).
- `P4_nurse_safety_sequence.bpmn` — Month 4 Flow A nurse safety sequence (`STEP-4A-04..10`).
- `P5_coldchain_replacement.bpmn` / `P6_batch_recall.bpmn` — Month 5 Flow R safety-critical recoveries (`RFLOW-01`, `RFLOW-02`).
- `P7_urgent_side_effect.bpmn` — Month 4 Flow B side-effect report → escalation (`STEP-4B-08`, `RFLOW-05`).
- `P8_payment_subscription.bpmn` — Month 3 Flow A checkout + renewal (`STEP-3A-02`, `RFLOW-12`).

## 3. Architecture

**Backend** — microservices in FastAPI, kept deliberately coarse (about ten services from one shared template). Services: `auth` (identity, roles, KYC), `patient` (profile, EMR, eligibility, engagement), `prov` (doctor + nurse profiles, schedules, credentials, assignments), `visit` (online visits, prescriptions), `field` (nurse visits, injections, routing, inventory), `pay` (wallet, gateway, invoices, settlements), `pharm` (hub inventory, cold-chain), `sub` (subscriptions), `notif` (SMS/push/email), `crm` (customer service, affiliate), `rpt` (reporting/BI), `gw` (gateway/admin).

**Frontend** — microfrontends via Module Federation, composed by a host `shell`. Independently deployable remotes: `mfe-patient`, `mfe-doctor`, `mfe-nurse`, `mfe-pharmacy`, `mfe-admin`, `mfe-cs`, `mfe-affiliate`, and `mfe-marketing` (the **public** landing/marketing site — pre-auth, SSG/SSR-friendly for SEO). Shared packages: `pkg-design` (design system), `pkg-auth` (session SDK), `pkg-api` (typed clients), `pkg-i18n` (locale resolution, per-remote + shared message catalogs, RTL/LTR direction switching, and Jalali/Gregorian + numeral/currency formatting; ships `fa-IR` source + `en`, extensible by config — see `Medica_Internationalization.md`). Components call `pkg-api` → gateway → owning service; never a service directly.

**DevOps** — Kubernetes (ArvanCloud), GitLab CI + ArgoCD, logging to Loki, metrics to VictoriaMetrics with Grafana, tracing via OpenTelemetry — baked into the service template so every service is observable from its first deploy. Each deployable exposes health probes for Kubernetes: FastAPI services from the shared template, and each Next.js frontend via `GET /api/health` (liveness) + `GET /api/health/ready` (readiness) — unauthenticated, PHI-free, defined in `Medica_Site_Map.md`.

**Cross-cutting (built Month 1, used by every step):** `CMP-SHL-001 AppShell`, `CMP-SHL-002 SessionProvider`, `CMP-SHL-003 DesignSystem`, `CMP-SHL-006 LocaleProvider`, `CMP-SHL-007 LocaleSwitcher`; `API-GW-001` (gateway, incl. locale resolution), `API-AUTH-008 GET /auth/me`, `API-AUTH-010 POST /auth/token/refresh`. The `pkg-i18n` framework, the `fa-IR` source catalog, and `identity.preferred_locale` are foundational in Month 1 so every later screen is authored against message keys from day one (`Medica_Internationalization.md`).

**Data model.** Each microservice owns its own database (no cross-service foreign keys; services reference each other by `identity_id` or resource UUID). The persistent entities behind these APIs are defined in the companion `Medica_Data_Model.md`; the `data ·` lines below draw their field names from it. The states behind every `status` field, their legal transitions, and each state's UI treatment are defined in the companion `Medica_Lifecycle_State_Machines.md`.

## 4. Access model

### Identity and roles
One **identity** is one login (one phone number + password). An identity can hold **one or more roles**, and effective permissions are the union of all its roles. Supported cases include: an operations manager who is also a patient (`[ops_manager, patient]`), a doctor who uses the service themselves (`[doctor, patient]`), or a nurse who also handles support (`[nurse, cs_agent]`).

The JWT carries `sub` (identity id), `roles[]`, and the resolved `perms[]`. An optional `act` claim records which role the user is currently acting as for UI purposes; it never widens access beyond `perms[]`.

### Roles
`patient` · `doctor` · `nurse` · `pharmacy` (hub operator) · `cs_agent` (customer service) · `affiliate` · `ops_manager` · `finance` · `admin`.

### Permissions: `resource:action:scope`
- **resource** — patient, profile, eligibility, subscription, wallet, visit, prescription, nurse_visit, route, inventory, pharmacy, provider, assignment, finance, settlement, report, ops, content, support, cs, affiliate, config, role.
- **action** — read, write, create, conduct, issue, submit, run, manage.
- **scope** — `self` (only the authenticated subject's own data) · `assigned` (data linked to the actor by an assignment) · `any` (all data; admin/ops).

### Path conventions
- **`/me/...`** operates on the authenticated subject. The id comes from the JWT `sub` and is never in the path. Guarded by a `:self` permission. Used whenever a user acts on their own data.
- **`/{type}/{id}/...`** operates on another subject. The id is in the path. Guarded by a `:assigned` permission (with an assignment check) or `:any`. Used by providers and admins.

A single logical operation may be exposed at both routes, sharing one API_ID handler; each step shows the route and permission that apply to its actor.

### Enforcement
1. The **gateway** (`API-GW-001`) validates the JWT and checks the route's required permission is present in `perms[]`.
2. The **service** enforces scope: `self` requires the subject to equal `sub`; `assigned` looks up the assignment table; `any` is allowed.
3. Every cross-subject access is **audited** (`S-011`).

### Role → permission catalog (representative)

| Role | Key permissions |
|---|---|
| `patient` | `profile:write:self`, `eligibility:write:self`, `subscription:write:self`, `wallet:write:self`, `visit:create:self`, `visit:read:self`, `nurse_visit:read:self`, `content:read` |
| `doctor` | `patient:read:assigned`, `visit:conduct:assigned`, `prescription:issue:assigned`, `prescription:submit:assigned`, `finance:read:self` |
| `nurse` | `nurse_visit:write:assigned`, `route:read:self`, `inventory:write:self`, `finance:read:self` |
| `pharmacy` | `pharmacy:write:self`, `inventory:write:self`, `finance:read:self` |
| `cs_agent` | `cs:manage:any`, `support:write:any`, `patient:read:any` |
| `affiliate` | `affiliate:read:self`, `affiliate:write:self` |
| `ops_manager` | `ops:manage:any`, `assignment:write:any`, `provider:manage:any`, `report:read:any` |
| `finance` | `finance:read:any`, `settlement:run:any` |
| `admin` | `config:manage:any`, `role:manage:any`, plus all `:any` |

A `:self` permission only ever exposes that identity's own data, via `/me`. Cross access requires `:assigned` or `:any`. Roles are assigned at `STEP-4C-04`; assignments powering `:assigned` are created at `STEP-4C-10`.

- *`eligible` → continue to consent. `borderline`/`ineligible` → sets **`eligibility_assessment.review_status = review_pending`** and the screen shows a **"our support team will call you"** message — **no patient-facing book/pay action**; on every re-login the patient lands back on this pending state until CS moves it to `in_review`/`resolved`. CS/concierge unlocks the doctor-review booking + payment off-app (RFLOW-18). The `review_status` enum is added to `eligibility_assessment` in the data model.*

- comp · `CMP-MKT-003` · EligibilityCheck · mfe-marketing · public questionnaire → preliminary indicator → CTA to sign up for the full assessment (`STEP-2-06/07`)
- `[clinical]`: which questions form the public subset, the result framing, and the non-binding disclaimer are owned by the clinical-safety spec; the preview never returns a definitive verdict.


**STEP-2-11 — Patient home** · serves F-100

- api · `API-SUB-002` · POST /me/subscriptions · sub · create subscription
  - data · ← `package_id` · → `subscription{ id, status, renews_at }`

- *Ordering: subscription/payment comes **after** booking. A patient with no active subscription books into `status = pending_payment`; confirming the booking **requires** the subscription purchase (Flow A, `STEP-3A-02`), which flips the visit to `scheduled`. So the first visit booking is the gate that drives the subscription sale (User Flows `PF-D.U3 → R-SUBSCRIBE-GATE`). Flow A is still authored before Flow B here, but at runtime book-then-pay is the order.*

## 5. Multi-role behavior

- **Manager who is also a patient** (`[ops_manager, patient]`): in `mfe-patient` they call `/me/*` and see their own patient data (`:self` from the patient role); in `mfe-admin` they call `/patients/{id}`, `/ops/*` (`:any` from ops_manager). The two never bleed — `/me` is bound to their identity, the `{id}` routes are bound to a permission check.
- **Doctor who is also a patient** (`[doctor, patient]`): `/me/profile` returns their own health record; `/patients/{id}` returns a patient they're assigned to (assignment check). They cannot read an unassigned patient even though they hold the doctor role.
- **Nurse acting as a patient for themselves**: `/me/nurse-visits` returns visits where they are the *patient*; their nurse work lives under `/me/route` and `/nurse-visits/{id}` (assigned). The service distinguishes by which relationship the subject holds on each record.

Roles are assigned and revoked at `STEP-4C-04` (RoleManager). Assignments that power `:assigned` scope are created at `STEP-4C-10` (AssignmentBoard).

## 6. Traceability

Every screen traces in one line: `STEP → F (feature) → API (backend, with its data) + CMP (frontend)`, qualified by `actor` and `requires`. The API's `→` data list is what the component renders and the serializer's allowlist for that step; its `←` list is what the component submits. Use the STEP_ID as the unit of work in tickets and tests.

## 7. New data introduced by this layer

The data lines surfaced a small number of read shapes not present as base tables in the data model. They are **derived projections / read models**, not new stored fields, and are noted here so the data model's open-questions list stays accurate:
- `patient_summary{ identity_id, full_name, status, last_visit_at, next_visit_at }` — list projection for doctor/nurse/admin patient lists (`STEP-3B-04`, `5-11`, `4C-01`). Composed from `patient_profile` + `assignment` + `visit`.
- `nurse_note{ body, at }` — per-patient nurse notes (`STEP-5-11`, feature F-453). **This is genuinely new and should be added to the `field` service** as a `nurse_note` entity (`nurse_id`, `patient_id`, `body`). Flagged for the data model.
- `replacement_order` (`field`) and `recall` (`pharm`) — the two genuinely-new entities introduced by the safety-critical recovery layer (`STEP-R01-04`, `STEP-R02-01`); added to the data model. `API-PHARM-011`'s affected list is a `(derived)` read model, not a stored table, consistent with data-model §13. Full design in `Medica_Recovery_Flows.md`.
- `identity.preferred_locale` is added to `auth` and returned by `API-AUTH-008 GET /auth/me` (and carried as a non-authoritative JWT `locale` hint); the gateway resolves the effective locale per request. Static UI strings live in frontend message catalogs (`pkg-i18n`), not the DB; dynamic content is localized via existing `locale` columns. Full design in `Medica_Internationalization.md`.
- All `(derived)` dashboards (doctor, ops, finance, growth, performance, adherence, CS KPI) are read models populated from events, consistent with data-model §13.
